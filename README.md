# dotfiles

Backup of my dot files

Use at your own risk-especially the scripts! Some of them are hacked together or are poorly edited.

# Note
oh-my-zsh is required for the .zshrc unless you just want to copy my aliases or such. Make sure that the oh-my-zsh paths are correct. They should be with a default install.
